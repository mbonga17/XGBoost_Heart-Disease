XGBoost is a powerful machine learning algorithm used for heart disease prediction. 
It excels at handling complex datasets and can be used for both classification (predicting if a patient has heart disease) and regression (predicting the risk of heart disease) tasks. 
XGBoost's ability to optimize model parameters and its capacity to handle various data types make it a popular choice for building accurate and reliable heart disease prediction models
